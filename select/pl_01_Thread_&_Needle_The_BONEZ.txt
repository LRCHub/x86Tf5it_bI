What am I looking for
Will I know it tomorrow?
I don't know, I won't know it's
never sure
But there's more and more and I

One thread has attached on
Some things that you'll never
believe
That thread has attached on you
One thread has attached on you
Who am I looking for
Will I know it tomorrow?
I want to know, I will know, its
there for sure
I see more and more and I know

One thread has attached on
Some things that you'll never
believe
That thread has attached on you
(It could be)
One thread has attached on
Something's that you'll never
believe
That thread will wake you from a
fool
That thread needs a needle
One thread through the needle
That thread needs a needle
You thread and mine
One thread...
One thread...
Just one thread...
One thread...
How could
One thread has attached on
Some things that you'll never
believe
That thread will wake you...
One thread has attached on
Something's that you'll never

One thread has attached on
Something's that you'll never

That thread will wake you from a
fool
That thread will wake you from a
fool
I'm just waking now
One thread has attached on
Some things that you'll never
believe
That thread will wake you from a
fool
That thread needs a needle
One thread through the needle
That thread needs a needle
You thread and mine

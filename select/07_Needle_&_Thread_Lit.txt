Sometimes you wonder what's wrong with my mind
You try to find it but there's nothing to find
Whoa, you'll never know
I keep on fallin' but I don't hit the floor
You say there's somethin' but you're lookin' for more
Whoa, you'll never know
I wouldn't do you wrong
Over again

Here's the needle and
Thread to mend your broken heart
Here's the needle and
Thread to mend your broken heart

The words you're screaming echo in my head
You're feelin' blue and you're seein' red
Whoa, you'll never know
I'm trying hard to think of something I sang
To make it better but you push me away
Whoa, you'll never know
Whoa, you'll never know

Here's the needle and
Thread to mend your broken heart
Here's the needle and
Thread to mend your broken

It don't take much to break you
You don't need this to make you

I wouldn't do you wrong
Over again

Here's the needle and
Thread to mend your broken heart
Here's the needle and
Thread to mend your broken heart
Here's the needle and
Thread to mend your broken heart
Here's the needle and
Thread to mend your broken... your broken... your broken!

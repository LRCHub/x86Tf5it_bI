Hanging by a thread connecting me to you
To who I've always been
To all we said we'd do
A fine thread, not tough enough to bear
The weight of desire and despair
Untended, the fibres start to fray
The long years of working as one
Were just washed away
Well maybe it was just our time
Forgive me, remember that I'm
A good man, just not good enough
Don't hate me, I was just in love
And hanging by a thread
Hold me in your arms
Where everything made sense
Where I knew right from wrong
Could live with restlessness
All my life I won't forget the pain in your eyes
I'm still scrubbing at the stain of this mess
Wish you could understand
The madness that grabbed at my throat
And clung to my hands
Well maybe it was just our time
Forgive me, remember that I'm
A good man, just not good enough
Don't hate me, I was just in love
And caught in my own net
Hanging, left spinning in the wind
Sliding, you grab at anything
Just lost our way, we just lost our way
You try to be all things to all men
And wind up with a love that's spread too thin
Just lost our way
The walls that we built were just washed away
Well maybe it was just our time
Forgive me, remember that I'm
A good man, just not good enough
Don't hate me, I was just in love
And hanging by a thread

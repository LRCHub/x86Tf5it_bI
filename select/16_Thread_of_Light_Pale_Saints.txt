Hey percy
The beauty hidden in the pain
I smile and i bleed
Body rain

Between the scenes
You should hold someone
Every piece is time
You've undone

Pretty boy
Everything lost and still a sound
Of mother's arms and soul
Can be found

Between the scenes
You should hold someone

Between the scenes
You should hold someone
Every piece is time
You've undone

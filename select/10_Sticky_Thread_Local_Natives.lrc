[00:21.10] Why didn't I say anything until now?
[00:34.37] So much is said without a sound
[00:42.23] Water so calm and once so pure, undisturbed
[00:55.66] Standing for so long the color turns
[01:03.46] Their work is so hard, their work is so hard
[01:25.46] 
[01:43.81] We never felt the sticky thread
[01:50.39] The spider webs
[01:56.83] Their balance in the garden
[02:04.72] Their work is so hard, their work is so hard

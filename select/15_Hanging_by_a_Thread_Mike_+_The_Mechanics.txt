And through the grief and pain, I'm half insane
I give an inch, you take a mile
You throw away the key, ignore my plea
You cut me down without a trial

(You keep me hanging by)
Hanging by a thread
(You keep me hanging by)
Leaving me for dead
(You keep me hanging by)
I heard it when you said
(You keep me hanging by)
Keep him hanging by a thread

You throw a length of rope, I grab, you hope
It's just enough to hang myself
I make a fatal slip, I lose my grip
There's no one left to call for help

(You keep me hanging by)
Hanging by a thread
(You keep me hanging by)
Leaving me for dead
(You keep me hanging by)
I'm not finished yet
(You keep me hanging by)
I'm still hanging by a thread
